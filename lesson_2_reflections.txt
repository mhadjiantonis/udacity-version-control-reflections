What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An empty git repository is created.  By initializing a repository we are 
enabling ourselves to track the history of specific files it contains.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains only those files in the working directory that
are to be included in a new commit of the repository.  It offers a space
to collect all the changes that must be commited.
