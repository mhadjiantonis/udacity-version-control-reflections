When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

This is useful when collaborating with other people or when we want to keep 
backup copies of our work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This might be usedul when you want to alsways have a backup version of our 
work online, or when we want our collaborators to be able to see the
progress we are maing.
