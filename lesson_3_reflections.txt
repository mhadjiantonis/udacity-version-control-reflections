When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

This is useful when collaborating with other people or when we want to keep 
backup copies of our work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This might be usedul when you want to alsways have a backup version of our 
work online, or when we want our collaborators to be able to see the
progress we are maing.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

Fork are copies of a repository directly from a GitHub account to another.  
Clones are copies of repositories either from GitHub to a local address on our
computer or from one local address to another.  Branches, are parts of one 
repository that include changes for different purposes.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

Having this, we are able to compare our changes with the version on the cloud.
We can also use this branch to fetch changes made obline that we have not yet
implemented and merge them to our code.
